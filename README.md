# Project Overview: Golden Section Search Console Application
## Introduction: 
This project aims to develop a console application for performing the Golden Section Search algorithm, a simple and efficient method for optimizing functions. The console application will provide users with a user-friendly interface to input a mathematical function, search interval, and other parameters to find the minimum of the function.

## Project Objectives:
- Create a user-friendly console interface for the Golden Section Search algorithm.
- Allow users to input a mathematical function.
- Enable users to specify the search interval [a, b].
- Implement the Golden Section Search algorithm to find the minimum of the function.
- Display the iteration history and final result.


## Scope:
- The project scope is limited to implementing the Golden Section Search algorithm in a console application.
- The application will handle one-dimensional optimization problems.
- The focus is on simplicity and ease of use for users who want to find the minimum of a function.

## Key Deliverables:
- Console application for Golden Section Search.
- User-friendly interface.
